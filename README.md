# Databases-Project-Course-Tracker
This is a final project for Principles of Database Systems by Danny Lewis, Andrew Donofrio, and George Long.

To get the code to work, open the latest version of Oracle SQL Developer and run the "course-tracker-schema.sql" as a script. Then run the sample data to populate the database with sample values, or come up with your own data and run the insert commands. You should now have a fully functional course tracking database. Check out the "sample-queries.sql" to see some of the cool things you can do with it.
